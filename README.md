# CNN/ANN:
Project - Convolutional Neural Networks: Street View Housing Number Digit Recognition (SVHN)

# Context:
Deep learning helps to recognize objects in natural scenes. The ability to process visual information using machine learning algorithms can be very useful.

The dataset used contains over 600,000 labeled digits cropped from street-level photos. It is one of the most popular image recognition datasets.
